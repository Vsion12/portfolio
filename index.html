    <h4>The story</h4>
    <p> I have always been fascinated by how the internet works and how digital projects get realized. This led to the decision to become part professional community. However, at the time, which was sort 3 years ago (shamefully), there was the question of where to start, which online platform to take up a course with and which area of IT to get my feet wet with for a start. Then one day as i was casually chatting with a like-minded acquaintance, who had had the same initiative at around the same time as myself, I learned from him that he was now living his dream and was already a professional intermediate backend engineer. I had the coldest realization that while others worked towards their dreams, I was enjoying mine in slumber. That was a <i>LOUD</i> wake-up call and it was enough to awake from 3-years of procrastination and slumber. And yes, sure to your prediction, my first knowledge about Alt-school came through him. Another bit that influenced choosing Alt-school was learning it is a platform for learning devoted to Africa and run by Africans. I couldn't be prouder to join.
